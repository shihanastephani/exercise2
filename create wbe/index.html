				<h4>ROME</h4>
				<p>No surprise to see Rome sitting on top of the list! The Italian capital city will always be 
					<br>a firm favourite, along with Italy's other star destinations.Local guide Fabio tells us: 
					“As has happened for most cities, Roma has also of course been impacted by the pandemic, yet its atmosphere has somehow changed for the best, since the local government has allowed cafes, restaurants and bars to use outdoor space more than ever before, giving owners the possibility to increase the number of tables outside for gathering. 
					This creates less space for cars parked everywhere and a nicer atmosphere in the city centre.”
